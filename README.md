Check out my Crypto and Stock Prices App built with React.js, Css, and Html! This app utilizes multiple Api keys, Routes, useState and useEffect along with Axios to pull financial data on stocks and crypto prices. 

This app provides up to date information on most active and popular stocks and crypto!

I have also included a page utlizing the code from https://www.youtube.com/@PedroTechnologies (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgG2_tBDWjE&list=PLmV2fniI1DjS7B9tIaRsVnAJxLIrSbnAi&index=15) as bonus for an added search option for finding all currrent crypto prices and symbols with the imported API key and rendered to the DOM. Enjoy!
